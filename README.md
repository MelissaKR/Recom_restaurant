# Recom_restaurant


This project recommends top 5 neighborhoods in Manhattan for opening an Italian restaurant based on Foursquare data on restaurant locations in Manhattan and NYPD's crime data. K-Means clustering is used to group Italian restaurants in all neighborhoods in Manhattan based on the density of Italian restaurants and crime rates of each respective neighborhood.
